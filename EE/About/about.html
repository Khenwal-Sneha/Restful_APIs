        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>17th December 1981 saw the dawn of Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology, at Nanded. Approved by the All India council for Technical Education, Government of India, it was registered under the Society’s Act, 1960 and was 100% funded by Government of Maharashtra.
            Sant Shri Baba Harnamji trust donated a land of 46 Acres for giving the name to this institution which is named after 10th Sikh Guru, Shri Guru Gobind Singhji. It was steered by the Governing Board, with the Director of Technical Education at its helm. Prof. B.M. Naik took over as first full-time Principal in 1983. Since then the institute has grown leaps and bounds.
            In 2004, the institute on the basis of a survey (conducted by a committee headed by Dr. F. C. Kohli, Chairman TCS) published in Business India (TOI), identified as an institute (one amongst three) with potential for excellence. The Government of Maharashtra took the initiative of granting autonomous status to select engineering colleges in the State under its TEQIP program. The SGGS Institute of Engineering and technology has the privilege of being one of the selected few to be offered total autonomy- academic, financial and administrative ( on the recommendations of Naik Committee report (As per the GR No. WBP-2001/(47/01)/TE-5 dated 19th July 2001) and TEQIP requirements. In the Eligibility Criterion of NPIU, Institute secured 59 Marks out of 63 and is selected under TEQIP for assistance and provided stiff competition to other institutes.
            Mr. B.N. Kalyani, an eminent industrialist, heading the Kalyani Group of Companies, has been nominated by the Government of Maharashtra as its first Chairman of the Governing Board (2004 to 2016). Subsequently Mr. Sunil Raithatta, Chairman and MD of Vinodrai Engineers Pvt. Ltd. Jalna was appointed as Chairman (2016-2019). In March 2019, Mr. Rajesh Pawar was appointed as Chairman (2019). The Government has also appointed renowned personalities form business and industry, academics and its senior administrative cadre on the Governing Board. The Institute will continue to receive block grants from the Government of Maharashtra, from time to time. The SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology enjoys a sprawling campus of over 46 acres, donated by Sant Baba Harnam Singh Langer sahib Gurudwara trust and is affiliated to Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded.<p>
